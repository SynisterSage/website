# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and policies for aferguson.art.

## Scope
This security policy applies to:
- Main website: https://aferguson.art
- API endpoints: https://aferguson.art/api/*
- All subdomains and services

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Transport Security
- **HTTPS Enforced**: All connections use TLS 1.3
- **HSTS Enabled**: HTTP Strict Transport Security with 2-year max-age
- **Certificate Pinning**: Via HSTS preload list submission

### 2. Content Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: SAMEORIGIN prevents clickjacking
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser XSS filter enabled

### 3. Privacy Protection
- **Referrer Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin limits referrer information
- **Permissions Policy**: Disables unnecessary browser features (camera, mic, etc.)
- **No Third-Party Cookies**: Minimal external dependencies

### 4. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and brute force attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to same-origin by default
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **No Indexing**: API endpoints excluded from search engines

### 5. Data Protection
- **No Sensitive Data Storage**: Client-side storage minimized
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Firestore access strictly controlled
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets never exposed to client
- **Secure Session Management**: Tokens and sessions properly managed

### 6. Infrastructure Security
- **DDoS Protection**: Via Vercel's edge network
- **WAF Protection**: Web Application Firewall at edge level
- **Automatic Patching**: Dependencies kept up to date
- **Secure Deployments**: Immutable deployments via Vercel

## Vulnerability Disclosure
