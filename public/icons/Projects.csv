"dominos-redesign","true","Dominos App Redesign","2025","UI/UX","UI/UX, App Design","Figma","This mobile redesign reimagines the Domino’s ordering experience with a sharper, more intuitive user flow and a bold flat-UI aesthetic. Created as a class assignment, it became a passion project driven by my love for improving everyday digital experiences. The goal was simple: fix the frustrating UX of the existing app and make pizza ordering fast, clear, and visually cohesive.

I rebuilt the entire design system from the ground up with clean, modular components, defined states, and a flexible variable structure supporting light and dark modes. The color palette was reinvented for vibrancy and contrast, while typography stays confident yet readable. Every interaction, from micro animations to modal transitions, was refined to feel responsive and satisfying.

The new flow dramatically reduces the number of steps to browse the menu, build a pizza, and check out. Features like guest checkout and simplified navigation remove friction while keeping the brand’s personality intact. I validated improvements through peer feedback and user testing, iterating based on real behavior.

It’s a complete end-to-end Figma prototype that feels modern, efficient, and cohesive from screen to screen, a redesign that makes ordering pizza actually enjoyable.","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/DYw7W2wsYFvScmcLFOdJaep1PFU.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/WtT9NTnAsC49CJ3RmX47J2j0.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/kOubBXu96zacqi0CUQlUVFET3I.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/UZw820qOkhE7lVKOEw3YvhxPmP0.jpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<iframe style=""border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"" width=""800"" height=""450"" src=""https://embed.figma.com/proto/dJgsXGf3LhAJuVZAnJyLqh/Dominos-Redesign-Main-File?node-id=108-916&p=f&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=108%3A914&show-proto-sidebar=1&embed-host=share"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
"overtone-app","true","Overtone App","2025","App Development","UI/UX, Full Stack Development","TypeScript, React","Deployed as Overtone, this mobile-first drum-tuning companion was prototyped and designed in Figma, then coded in TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and hosted on Vercel. I built it to replace an older tuner that I stopped maintaining, with the goal of having something I trust for daily practice and gigs. The interface supports light and dark modes for studio and stage, and the app runs as a fast single-page experience so it feels instant on phones. An embedded test link is available in my portfolio so you can preview the live build below.

At its core is a Hz mic pickup written in JavaScript using the Web Audio API that listens through the device mic and detects the fundamental in real time. A locking system holds the reading once the pitch stabilizes so fine adjustments are easy and the value does not jump around. A Settings page lets you dial in detection behavior with sensitivity, noise gate, averaging window, min and max Hz, A4 reference, and input device selection. You can create kits with named drums, sizes, targets, and saved last-locked values so moving around the kit is quick and consistent. The main tuner view keeps focus with a large frequency readout, note mapping, peak hold, clear Live and Locked states, and simple cues that work in noisy rooms. Continuous deploys keep the embedded demo current while I iterate on per-lug workflows and quick session presets.","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/W3Gn8czdRbjWRXtVQgkKpIq2jQ.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://testapp-rust.vercel.app/",""

The process book traces the build from research and sketching into grid construction, drawing, spacing/kerning, and refinement of key glyphs (W, Q, K, J, R, D), using an orange-cream visual system and texture studies to echo the project’s material theme.

Commissioned after the club’s website rework, I designed and delivered the full flow for tee-time booking, event/tournament registration, and turn-aware food ordering (pickup, cart delivery, or at the turn). Staff operate a live, no-refresh dashboard where orders, tee sheets, and check-ins stream through Firebase listeners and Vercel APIs, while Postgres permissions gate each station’s tools: the kitchen advances tickets (Received → In Prep → Ready), cart staff mark En Route/Delivered, and the pro shop approves or adjusts tee times and pairings—instantly reflected to members and written to Postgres for audit/reporting. Highlights: a tee sheet with conflict detection, drag-to-reschedule, bulk weather-delay actions, and course/day/hole filters; food ordering with prep-time estimates, throttle controls, and a color-coded queue; and events with registration caps, waitlists, one-tap check-in, scoring exports, and live reporting—an experience that feels instant for members and like a control room for staff.","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/KOf5heXwVaHDO8hg2qopgvXswRw.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://framerusercontent.com/assets/YbBOlz718cExMHA0VxFJasfd57I.mp4","https://framerusercontent.com/assets/W34LCAauNfUZcnj7v5yIy9zAcw.mp4","","","","",""

I launched the product solo, covering strategy, branding, UI/UX, front-end engineering, PR and graphics, customer support, and Heroku deployments. As traction grew, I hired backend developers to maintain services, increase reliability, and meet demand while I continued to lead product and design.

SageAIO shipped with a cohesive dark UI and gradient accents across a complete suite: a Home dashboard with real-time analytics, a Tasks hub for high-volume task groups, Profiles for payment and shipping, a Proxies manager for IP rotation, and Settings with license-key auth, auto updates, and advanced toggles. Discord webhooks delivered instant status and success notifications. Memberships were intentionally capped, yet we served 100+ paying users and built a loyal community on X at @SageAIO. The project concluded when I returned to school, and it ended on great terms with customers reporting strong profits and a brand and UI that outperformed much larger competitors.","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/CC2oKU1wYskQEv4iuYPx3etgKY.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/F2aZyPEu3rPCcmFabD4ep6L4.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/4V0q6SQaLCm03KLYwn6S3cwMlmE.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/9LZZPyFykkxHEsD3KhxQrlFEwGg.jpg","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/Q3FQKIj0C1hr9DzlTt9rfaaZp8.jpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typography follows a clear hierarchy, and the color palette stays cohesive across light accents and dark text for readable contrast. Components are modular and repeatable, including cards, buttons, inputs, tabs, and recipe tiles with defined states for hover, focus, loading, and errors.

I went all in and produced a fully functional Figma prototype that covers end-to-end flows: upload, discovery, profiles, search and filters, and detailed nutrition with macros.
