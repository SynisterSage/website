    fullDescription: `This mobile redesign reimagines the Domino's ordering experience with a sharper, more intuitive user flow and a bold flat-UI aesthetic. Created as a class assignment, it became a passion project driven by my love for improving everyday digital experiences. The goal was simple: fix the frustrating UX of the existing app and make pizza ordering fast, clear, and visually cohesive.

I rebuilt the entire design system from the ground up with clean, modular components, defined states, and a flexible variable structure supporting light and dark modes. The color palette was reinvented for vibrancy and contrast, while typography stays confident yet readable. Every interaction, from micro animations to modal transitions, was refined to feel responsive and satisfying.

The new flow dramatically reduces the number of steps to browse the menu, build a pizza, and check out. Features like guest checkout and simplified navigation remove friction while keeping the brand's personality intact. I validated improvements through peer feedback and user testing, iterating based on real behavior.

It's a complete end-to-end Figma prototype that feels modern, efficient, and cohesive from screen to screen—a redesign that makes ordering pizza actually enjoyable.`,

    fullDescription: `Deployed as Overtone, this mobile-first drum-tuning companion was prototyped and designed in Figma, then coded in TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and hosted on Vercel. The interface supports light and dark modes for studio and stage, and the app runs as a fast single-page experience so it feels instant on phones.

At its core is a Hz mic pickup written in JavaScript using the Web Audio API that listens through the device mic and detects the fundamental in real time. A locking system holds the reading once the pitch stabilizes so fine adjustments are easy and the value does not jump around. Settings let you dial in detection behavior and create kits with named drums, sizes, and saved values. The main tuner view keeps focus with a large frequency readout, note mapping, peak hold, and clear Live/Locked states. Continuous deploys keep the embedded demo current while iterating on workflows and presets.`,

The family includes multiple weights from Light to Bold, each crafted to maintain consistency across sizes. Special attention was paid to kerning pairs and OpenType features to ensure professional-grade typesetting results. A specimen book showcases Velkro in various applications, from editorial layouts to poster designs.`
